# MinitelPhoenix

This project contain the source code of a minimalist OS for a minitel.

This OS has been written in python3 and has to be launch on a rasberry connected on a minitel via a converter.

At the origin this project is a school project proposed by the "hub innovation" of EPITECH Toulouse.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to be able to connect to a wifi by choosing a SSID and typing the apropriate password on a minitel. After this step the UI display on the screen a menu where the user can choose ether to use a service or to type an URL. The web site behind the URL will be printed and the user will be able to read a web page on a minitel!
The services are not implemented due to the stopped developpement of the API.
